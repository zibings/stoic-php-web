# Stoic API Components
Collection of specialized components to aid in building straightforward API's.

## Approach
Since API's rely heavily on the composition of their URL's, it was appropriate
to offer a semi-strict set of classes to facilitate building API endpoints that
live within a single directory.  This should feel very similar to an MVC-type
pattern, but still requires you to explicitly build your own entry file (a step
we feel encourages clearer understanding of program flow).
